# 🛠️ Portfolio-Man

A curated collection of automation scripts and whatever else I think is noteworthy to demonstrate that I am, in fact, not lying about what I've done professionally. All of the scripts herein have been developed to address recurring or complex issues arising from my work in SharePoint administration for a massive company and its associated difficulties. 
 
Nothing like spending a week to automate something that could've been done in two days if done tediously by hand.

## 📚 About This Repository

This portfolio contains **production-ready automation scripts** developed through hands-on systems administration experience, with a focus on SharePoint automation. All code is sanitized for security while preserving its original technical structure, and only requiring minor modifications to be put into use elsewhere.
The contents of this repository will continue to grow as I gain more experience and broaden my knowledge. I'll do my best to keep it updated.

> [!NOTE]
> Scripts are automatically sanitized and published from a private repository using CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions + Python). Sensitive information (company names, credentials, internal URLs) is replaced with generic placeholders.
